"treats the beloved like his very own god"
(1) If love leads one to build up an image of one into his god,
does this mean a blindness to the beloved's own reality?
(2) Is this an idol that falls short of and therefore dishonors the reality?

Socrates seeks to overcome those 2 errors.

"Those who choose to follow Zeus choose to ... follow Zeus in the nobility of his soul."
"Once they have found him and are in love with him ... they do everything to develop that talent."
One already has a likeness to Zeus.
Does not need to be conditioned -- already there.

philosophy = contemplation of reality

same desire of soul mediates vision of god

philosopher receives from the student, motivated from other to share truth with the other
