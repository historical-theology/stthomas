Augustine and Teaching

Scripture is God talking to us in human words
Where can we go to find an education? -- A's day, Roman schools (pagan)

A - we should use pagan learning, containing much truth

1 motivation for study and goal is linked with existential situation, longing for God
Xian ed. is part of quest for G

2 study of Scripture = foundation & pinnacle
all other learning finds fulfillment in that

3 encountering G
Conf., looking at reality -> God

4 pagan liberal arts education is part of life of faith
part of an act of piety

11 and 12 centuries
Hugh's Didaskalion
update A for urban school env
purpose of arts = purpose of Scripture, goal being restoration of image of God w/in fallen humans by way of wisdom

philosophy's 21 arts are paths to wisdom

Bonaventure -- reductio ad theologiam

end of truly Xian ed. is love for G

---

for A, we only need studies, and even Scriptures themselves -- revelation -- in our postlapsarian context
in biblical texts themselves, notably Ecclesiastes, Wisdom, and the sort of totality of the received Hebrew into Jewish wisdom literary tradition,
we are repeatedly told how little of wisdom we can see because of our blindness, that blindness quite plainly being the cosmic blinders (as it were) that Paul,
drawing on this tradition, identifies with the names Sin and Death
A, therefore, has no sense of the absolute need for any learning. To the contrary, learning itself is a kind of purgatory.
This idea is preserved among the lat(est) Greek Fathers, arguably even someone like John of Damascus, for whom Hellenistic learning is rote and routine -- the regular but enlightening 'humdrum,'' as it were, of Eastern aristocratic upbringing.
Yet, in the Latin West, probably starting with the Victorines (thank you for drawing us to Hugh), we have this inversion, as it were, with learning being a good per se.
What do you make of this?

The reality is that our theological classes in the Core are not scriptural.
FRR has no Scripture at all, save what I have personally brought into it.
SSH is titled as about Scripture, but it is really about salvation history.
RTG as I have assembled it is not biblical but patristic.
What do you make of the case that you have prudently set forth vis-a-vis the context in which you would be entering were you to work here?
