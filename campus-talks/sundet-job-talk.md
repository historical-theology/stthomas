Leta Sundet, Ph.D.
Improvement and Change in Jane Austen's *Mansfield Park*

conference presentation forthcoming re: novel she knows well: Mansfield Park by Jane Austen
"accords well with the concerns of the program here at UST"

famously a novel about 'improvement'
against a craze to 'improve' estates
proposterous sums of money spent on the task
nothing ever comes of Mr. Rushford's plans for improvement
prefigures destruction

Henry has an arc of non-improvements: self-assured improver -> havoc wrecker at Mansfield -> self-improver for love -> returner to self-assured improver

Even the novel's worldly characters become conscious of their lack of sense of 'the good life'

"What should one do when confronted with a world of lives objectively in need of change?"
natural growth
human change, too, often happens quietly, subtly, and independently of human ingenuity

force reality into shape one desires?

Mariah does not know herself and, therefore, does not know how to come into herself

'unselfish' improvement of Mariah's life and others'

marriage for money = artificial improvement of life
marriage for love = cutting against the grain, about improvement of one's nature, as it were

reality is governed by more than our own wills

corrective to thinking that we can 'bypass death,' i.e. avoid the suffering needed for flourishing

My Q
For this question, Dr. Sundet, you have the advantage of already having taught Celts. Yet, I still want to paint a stark picture to frame the matter:
A room full of 18 and 19 year old women and men who never have read full books before, struggling even to follow intentionally maximally accessible material, material that is even more accessible than the modern, conversational English literature that is Austen --
How do you guide them into and through Mansfield Park?
What project or projects do you have them do?
What questions do you have them ask?
Why? In other words, what is/are the takeaways vis-a-vis the liberation of liberal arts? Pointing toward history, theology, philosophy, biology, psychology? How so?
