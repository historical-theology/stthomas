## Core Curriculum

# The Return to God

Corey Stephan, Ph.D.

Fall 2022 - online and asynchronous

The glory of God is man fully alive, but the life of man is the vision of God.

-St. Irenaeus, Against Heresies IV

You have made us for yourself, O Lord, and our hearts are restless until they rest in you.

-St. Augustine, Confessions I

A synthesis of readings and themes introduced in prior core instruction,
this course draws together fundamental questions considered throughout the curriculum
dealing with such topics as revelation, history, transcendence, suffering, death, and salvation.
The course orients life in the context of a Christian sacramental vision to
the final end of the human person: the contemplation of the vision of God.

## Spiritual partner

You will have a spiritual partner for the whole semester, that is, a
classmate with whom you meet weekly to discuss the hard contents of the class,
as well as (if you so choose) pray, meditate, etc. Together, you will submit a
video recording of the 'results' of each of your weekly discussions
as a public post in our Blackboard page.

## Destination
Guided by the riches of the Catholic intellectual and moral tradition, you will acquire the
knowledge and skills needed to confront, formulate, and answer the question of what makes
our lives, at bottom, unified and meaningful, and to see a Christian answer to that question as a
serious and persuasive one. You also will learn how in the concrete sacramental and spiritual
theology of the Church, such a meaningful life might realistically be pursued.

By the end of the semester, which is (of course) also the end of your time
as an undergraduate student at the University of St. Thomas:

1. You will be able to give an account of the contemplative end of man as fulfilled in the
Body of Christ.
2. You will show that they can accurately compare and contrast, in the light of divine
revelation, the conception of the human person as contemplative with one in which the
purely technical predominates.
3. You will be able to give an account of the progression of the spiritual life as flowing
from the sacraments and expressed in the liturgy of the Church.
4. You will be able accurately to articulate the sacramental world-view of Christian
theology and apply its consequences to their lives and the contemporary context.

I, Dr. Stephan, will consider anything short of this to be a failure -- most likely mine, but possibly yours.
This must be a team effort.

To that end, we have a [Return to God Class Survey and Contract](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe90-gY5dTRUQW7zTdTkV1IWS_d4vZzgmWiCa9sM8fYARMsqg/viewform))
that all of us, myself included, are required to sign by the end of the first week.

Above all, note that you are expected:
1. To do all assigned readings and watch or listen to all assigned lectures every week,
2. To prepare to record a video meeting with a class spiritual partner every Wednesday or Thursday (by doing #1), and
3. To prepare for a video meeting with the instructor (me, Dr. Stephan) every Friday (by doing #1 and #2).

Each week, then, you will follow the following rhythm:

* Reading and Lectures (Saturday, Monday-Thursday)-> 
* Partner Meeting (Wednesday or Thursday) -> 
* Instructor Meeting (Friday)

## Class Webpages
The [class webpage](https://www.coreystephan.com/teaching/return-to-god), which I
(Dr. Stephan) host on my professional website (coreystephan.com/teaching/return-to-god), will contain:
* this syllabus,
* lecture recordings (audio and/or video),
* blog posts,
* hyperlinks to class readings, and
* other (semi-)permanent materials related to the class.

Since this is a pilot/demo version of this class (and you are its first students), 
please also note that the
[class GitHub page](https://github.com/historical-theology/stthomas/return-to-god) 
will contain work-in-progress materials on which you should feel free to comment 
in order to assist my colleagues and me
in building the future of the University of St. Thomas.

## Required Books

All of these books are strictly required in order to participate in the class.
We will be reading six of these seven items in full; only the Bible will be excerpted
(and that for three whole Books).
All of these items are available pre-owned, as cheap paperbacks, and/or for rental, 
and the total cost should be lower than that of even one textbook in some disciplines.
Nevertheless, if the cost of acquiring these items should be a burden for you, 
then I encourage you to check the library for copies (including via interlibrary loan)
and/or split the costs with a classmate by sharing. 
If all of that should fail or otherwise not be viable,
then do please speak with me (Dr. Stephan) in private about a financial accomodation.

## University Policies

### Accommodations
If you have an academic accommodation and wish to make use of it,
you are strongly encouraged to do so. As a general rule, I will receive your accom-
modation letter directly from the Office of Counseling and Disability Services.
However, I encourage you to check with me (Dr. Stephan) to make sure that I have received and
implemented any accommodations to which you are entitled. Any student with a
disability requiring accommodations in this course is encouraged to contact me
after class or during office hours. Discussions of matters pertaining to academic
accommodations will remain confidential. Additionally, students seeking such
an accommodation will need to contact Counseling and Disability Services (CDS)
in Crooker Center. This office can be reached at (713) 525-2169 or 6953.

### Preparation
You must have all the required textbooks, ideally as soon as the class be-
gins. Their ISBN numbers must match those on the syllabus. It is the student’s
responsibility, not the bookstore’s, to arrange to have the proper books.

### Meetings
I encourage you to meet with the TA outside of the classroom, especially
for guidance on the readings and assignments. Generally, appointments will be
handled via Teams.

### Communication
You must use university email or Teams for electronic correspondence
with me and with the TA. Any lost or missed communication as a result of using
third party email, or failing to maintain one’s UST email account under quota will
be considered the student’s fault.

## Other Class Policies

### Late Submissions
I know that life happens, and I know that the best work sometimes has to be submitted late
(the Sistine Chapel's painting went behind schedule, after all).

At the same time, this class is a team effort, so
we all must strive to have our work to share with each other on time.
Even one 'weak link' can tear down everyone's experience; you
(as an individual student) really do matter to the class as a whole.

With all that in mind, let me make this policy as simple as possible:
1. With legitimate excuse(s), I will accept up to 2 late submissions from you with no penalty.
2. Without legitimate excuse(s), or if you are submitting a third item
(of three formal submissions, no less!) late, then you will incur a 10% penalty per day.
3. After the grading deadline has passed at the end of the semester,
I will not accept any more work.

### Revision
For either the Augustine video presentation or the Liturgy attendance assignment,
if you are not satisfied with your grade,
you may do a full revision (or even start from scratch) and resubmit
for full credit as though it were your first submission.

Other assignments are too linked to specific moments in time for revision to be possible,
but it is important to me that you be able to be graded for your best work,
which might mean needing to revise it after you have received my constructive feedback.
