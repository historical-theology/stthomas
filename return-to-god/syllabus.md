## Core Curriculum

# The Return to God

Corey Stephan, Ph.D.
Fall 2022 - online and asynchronous

The glory of God is man fully alive, but the life of man is the vision of God.
-St. Irenaeus, Against Heresies IV

You have made us for yourself, O Lord, and our hearts are restless until they rest in you.
-St. Augustine, Confessions I

In this course, students will be introduced to what Catholic theology is, 
what its distinctive features and principles are, and why Catholic belief is reasonable. 
In so doing they will deepen their understanding of themselves as rational, free beings, 
capable of affirming what is true and of freely embracing the purpose of their existence.

## Journey
A synthesis of readings and themes introduced in prior core instruction,
this course draws together fundamental questions considered throughout the curriculum
dealing with such topics as revelation, history, transcendence, suffering, death, and salvation.
The course orients life in the context of a Christian sacramental vision to
the final end of the human person: the contemplation of the vision of God.

## Destination
Guided by the riches of the Catholic intellectual and moral tradition, you will acquire the
knowledge and skills needed to confront, formulate, and answer the question of what makes
our lives, at bottom, unified and meaningful, and to see a Christian answer to that question as a
serious and persuasive one. You also will learn how in the concrete sacramental and spiritual
theology of the Church, such a meaningful life might realistically be pursued.

By the end of the semester, which is (of course) also the end of your time
as an undergraduate student at the University of St. Thomas:

1. You will be able to give an account of the contemplative end of man as fulfilled in the
Body of Christ.
2. You will show that they can accurately compare and contrast, in the light of divine
revelation, the conception of the human person as contemplative with one in which the
purely technical predominates.
3. You will be able to give an account of the progression of the spiritual life as flowing
from the sacraments and expressed in the liturgy of the Church.
4. You will be able accurately to articulate the sacramental world-view of Christian
theology and apply its consequences to their lives and the contemporary context.

I, Dr. Stephan, will consider anything short of this to be a failure -- whether yours, mine, or both.
This must be a team effort.

To that end, we have a [Return to God Class Contract](https://www.coreystephan.com/teaching/return-to-god/contract)
that all of us, myself included, are required to sign by the end of the first week.

## Class Webpages
The [class webpage](https://www.coreystephan.com/teaching/return-to-god), which I
(Dr. Stephan) host on my professional website (coreystephan.com/teaching/return-to-god), will contain:
* this syllabus,
* lecture recordings,
* blog posts,
* hyperlinks to class readings, and
* other (semi-)permanent materials related to the class.

Since this is a pilot/demo version of this class, the
[class GitHub page](https://github.com/historical-theology/stthomas/return-to-god) will contain
work-in-progress materials on which you (as test smarties) may comment, etc.

Generally speaking, I (Dr. Stephan), like most full-time university faculty members,
have far too many emails. It is 

## Pace and Themes
This is an intensive, three credit, and senior-level capstone course. 
The course does not have a specific group meeting time, but in order to stay on track, 
you should expect to work on this class every day, except for Sundays and holidays. 
The schedule of readings and assignments is designed with this pace in mind. 

The course is divided into five thematic units that will last three weeks apiece:
1. Creation: Fundamentally Good but Absolutely Breakable
2. Fall: All is (*not*) Lost
3. Christ: The Savior
4. Life in the Church
5. Eschaton and Eternity.

Each of these themes aligns with both
1. Salvation History and
2. The Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed
