## Core Curriculum

# The Return to God

Instructor: Corey Stephan, Ph.D.

* Email: corey.stephan@stthom.edu

Fall 2022: ONLINE AND ASYNCHRONOUS [WIP]

Notes:
1. Some submission deadlines are to be determined.
2. I reserve the right as the instructor to revise this syllabus at any time during the semester.

***

The glory of God is man fully alive, but the life of man is the vision of God.

-St. Irenaeus, Against Heresies IV

You have made us for yourself, O Lord, and our hearts are restless until they rest in you.

-St. Augustine, Confessions I

A synthesis of readings and themes introduced in prior core instruction, this course draws together fundamental questions considered throughout the curriculum dealing with such topics as revelation, history, transcendence, suffering, death, and salvation. The course orients life in the context of a Christian sacramental vision to the final end of the human person: the contemplation of the vision of God.

***

## Spiritual Partner

You will have a spiritual partner for the whole semester, that is, a classmate with whom you meet weekly to discuss the hard contents of the class, as well as (if you so choose) pray, meditate, etc. Together, you will submit video recordings of the 'results' of many of your discussions as a post on the Blackboard page.

## Destination
Guided by the riches of the Catholic intellectual and moral tradition, you will acquire the knowledge and skills needed to confront, formulate, and answer the question of what makes our lives, at bottom, unified and meaningful, and to see a Christian answer to that question as a serious and persuasive one. You also will learn how in the concrete sacramental and spiritual
theology of the Church, such a meaningful life might realistically be pursued.

By the end of the semester, which is (of course) also near the end of your time as an undergraduate student at the University of St. Thomas:
1. You will be able to give an account of the contemplative end of man as fulfilled in the
Body of Christ.
2. You will show that they can accurately compare and contrast, in the light of divine
revelation, the conception of the human person as contemplative with one in which the
purely technical predominates.
3. You will be able to give an account of the progression of the spiritual life as flowing
from the sacraments and expressed in the liturgy of the Church.
4. You will be able accurately to articulate the sacramental world-view of Christian
theology and apply its consequences to their lives and the contemporary context.

I, Dr. Stephan, will consider anything short of this to be a failure--most likely mine, but possibly yours.
This must be a team effort.

To that end, we have a [Return to God Class Survey and Contract](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe90-gY5dTRUQW7zTdTkV1IWS_d4vZzgmWiCa9sM8fYARMsqg/viewform)) that all of us, myself included, are required to sign by the end of the first week.

Above all, note that you are expected:
1. To do all assigned readings and watch or listen to all assigned lectures every week,
2. To prepare to record a video meeting with a class spiritual partner every Wednesday or Thursday (by doing #1), and
3. To prepare for a video meeting with the instructor (me, Dr. Stephan) every Friday (by doing #1 and #2).

## Class Webpages
The [class webpage](https://www.coreystephan.com/teaching/return-to-god), which I (Dr. Stephan) host on my professional website (coreystephan.com/teaching/return-to-god), will contain:
* this syllabus,
* lecture recordings (audio and/or video),
* blog posts,
* hyperlinks to class readings, and
* other (semi-)permanent materials related to the class.

Since this is a pilot/demo version of this class (and you are its first students), please also note that the [class GitHub page](https://github.com/historical-theology/stthomas/return-to-god) will contain work-in-progress materials on which you should feel free to comment in order to assist my colleagues and me in building the future of the University of St. Thomas.

## Required Books

All of these books are strictly required in order to participate in the class. We will be reading six of these seven items in full; only the Bible will be excerpted (and that for three whole Books). All of these items are available pre-owned, as cheap paperbacks, and/or for rental, and the total cost should be lower than that of even one textbook in some disciplines. Nevertheless, if the cost of acquiring these items should be a burden for you, then I encourage you to check the library for copies (including via interlibrary loan) and/or split the costs with a classmate by sharing. If all of that should fail or otherwise not be viable, then do please speak with me (Dr. Stephan) in private about a financial accomodation.

## Required Electronic Equipment

1. Stable Internet (WAN) access
2. Webcam (may be built-in, such as is ubiquitous in laptop computers)
3. Microphone (may be built-in, such as is ubiquitous in laptop computers)

You *must* be able to do live video conferencing, as well as self-recordings, for this class. You do *not* need to purchase any special, high-end equipment, but all of your audio and video (both live and recorded) *must* be clear. A smart phone generally will *not* work for our purposes (save, perhaps, one of the most expensive models). A tablet *might* work, but a proper computer 
with a desktop operating system (GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Apple MacOS, Microsoft Windows, etc.) will be best. You *may* (of course) use the equipment that is included in your tuition in the Doherty Library (and elsewhere on campus).

***

## Themes 

The course is divided into five thematic units that will last three weeks apiece:
1. Creation
2. Fall
3. Christ
4. Liturgy
5. Eternity

In lectures and discussions, we  will consider each of these themes as they align somewhat chronologically inside both
1. Salvation History and
2. The Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed

***

## University Policies

### Accommodations

In accordance with Section 504 of the Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the University of St. Thomas will provide academic accommodations to ensure access for students with disabilities.
     
Students with disabilities who require accommodations for this class, must register with the Office of Access & Disability Services (ADS) and provide documentation of a disability to determine what accommodations are most appropriate. Please note that accommodations are not retroactive and disability accommodations are not provided until a Course Accessibility Letter has been provided to the instructor. For questions regarding academic accommodations and accessibility, please contact the Office of Access and Disability Services by email at ACCESS@STTHOM.EDU, or visit the ADS website at STTHOM.EDU/ACCESS.

### Preparation

You must have all the required textbooks, ideally as soon as the class begins. Their ISBN numbers must match those on the syllabus. It is your responsibility, not the bookstore’s, to arrange to have the proper books.

### Meetings

I encourage you to meet with the TA or me outside of the classroom, especially for guidance on the readings and assignments. Generally, appointments will be handled via Jitsi (meet.jit.si/DrStephan).

### Communication

You must use university email or Teams for electronic correspondence with me and with the TA. Any lost or missed communication as a result of using third party email, or failing to maintain one’s UST email account under quota will be considered to be your fault.

## Other Class Policies

### Late Submissions

I know that life happens, and I know that the best work sometimes has to be submitted late (the Sistine Chapel's painting went behind schedule, after all).

At the same time, this class is a team effort, so we all must strive to have our work to share with each other on time. Even one 'weak link' can tear down everyone's experience; you (as an individual student) really do matter to the class as a whole.

With all that in mind, let me make this policy as simple as possible:

1. With legitimate excuse(s), I will accept 1 late submission from you with no penalty.
2. Without legitimate excuse(s), or if you are submitting a third item (of three formal submissions, no less!) late, then you will incur a 10% penalty per day.
3. After the grading deadline has passed at the end of the semester, I will not accept any more work.

### Revision

For whichever projects for which this is possible (*as noted explicitly by me, Dr. Stephan*):

If you are not satisfied with your grade, you may do a full revision (or even start from scratch) and resubmit for full credit as though it were your first submission.

### Statement on Software Freedom

I am a longtime advocate of Free Software as defined by the [Free Software Foundation](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html). I encourage you to teach yourself about software freedom. For my part, I promise that I will never require you to use non-free software, except tools that are currently required as part of our experience at the University of St. Thomas (e.g. Microsoft Teams). To the contrary, whenever possible, I will encourage or require you even to submit your work in formats with open standards.
