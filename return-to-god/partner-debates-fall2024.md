# Return to God

## Truth Troop Team Debates

### Corey Stephan, Ph.D.

##### Fall 2024

*For clarifications, please write to Dr. Stephan.*

Each Truth Troop Team will produce a formal, scripted debate about 1 aspect of traditional Christian belief on the theme of humanity's (re)turn to God as studied thus far inside this class.

I expect that each trio will choose a sub-topic within one theme from the class *or* some special topic of its members' choosing that relates (clearly, even if only tangentially) to the themes of the class. 

The themes thus far have been (1) Creation, (2) Fall, and (3) Christ, and we have done an wide array of readings inside each of those major themes. For simplicity's sake, I recommend debating a specific question that you have had about something contained inside one of those readings.
 
#### Basic Parameters

Each debate should fit the following parameters:

* Full video recording showing each partner's name and face in Blackboard -> Debates & Discussions -> PARTNER DEBATES -> [New thread]
* 10 minutes in duration (7 minutes minimum, 13 minutes maximum)
* Formal business attire
* Formal forms of address for one another, whether using real names (e.g. "Mr. Smith") or assumed personae (e.g. "Professor Smith")

Recommended:

* Approximately 1 minute opening statement from each side (including a clear introduction, that is, "My name is So-and-So, and I will be arguing such-and-such"), 3-9 minutes of back-and-forth, and 1 minute closing statement from each side
* Memorization (but scripts may be read, as long as the reading is done with 'heads up' in an overall lively manner)
To fit these parameters, *you must work together before the time of the debate to script your debates.* Using a shared document writing platform to which you already have access is a good idea. Here at the University of St. Thomas, we have ready-at-hand access to Microsoft Office 365 with Microsoft Word online as a collaborative writing tool that requires no outside accounts.

#### Submission

(1) Blackboard -> Debates & Discussions -> Partner Debates -> [New Thread]

(2) Title the thread with each teammate's name and the debate topic, like this:

"Last Name, Last Name, Last Name, Last Name: Debate Topic"

Here is an absurd tangible example: 

"Smith, Gonzalez, Nguyen, Mohammad: The Bright Colors of Dr. Stephan's Bow Ties and the Existential Dimension of the Problem of Evil"

(3) Paste your script with obvious statements/citations of sources (no style required -- just make it entirely obvious).

Here are 2 examples:

(a) "Factual information X and Y [hyperlink to good source] points to A and B"

(b) "Blah blah blah, as Catholic Study Bible pp. ### fn ### says, so blah blah blah"

(4) Attach your video recording of you as a trio debating. The recording should be in the same basic format as what you do in your study group recordings, that is, something that shows everyone's name, face, and voice.

(5) Submit new thread.

(6) Comment on 3 other trios' forum threads with 3 items each: (1) a tangible point of praise, (2) a tangible critique, and (3) a focused question.


#### Teams

Here are 2 examples of basic formats for this project that work well in teams of 4-5. You may, however, elect to use whatever format that you judge to be best for your team:

(1) Moderator, Side 1 (Debater + Debater), Side 2 (Debater + Debater)

In this format, the moderator serves as an *informed debate steerer*, asking helpful questions, providing factual context for points made, and so on. Each debater assumes the role of an expert on either side of a topic that is not challenging to paint as 1 side vs. 1 side. Each of 2 sides functions as a sub-team.

(2) Panel

In this format, everyone functions as a member of a panel within which each person assumes the role of an expert representing 1 position within a fraught topic. The panelists engage in a lively hybrid of an informed discussion and debate. Panelists may form sub-teams (e.g. Position 1,  Position 2, and Position 3) or appear individually.

#### Formal Feedback

After uploading the debate itself (asynchronous) and script (all classes) as a new thread in the Blackboard forum, partners should work together to provide critical feedback to **3 other teams' debates in their own respective threads.** To be graded properly, you must sign *all* of your team names to each response that you write. Each response must contain:

* 1 tangible point of praise for something argued (e.g. "The person who argued for A was right about B because of X and Y.")
* 1 point of critical feedback about something argued (e.g. "The point that each of you made about X contradicts points Y and Z that we have encountered elsewhere in class, specifically in...")
* 1 question for the original pair to consider, to which the original pair may choose to respond

#### Grades

Truth Troop Teams will be graded **together** for *both* your prepared debate recordings *and* your joint responses to 3 other trios.

You will be graded chiefly for two categories:
1. Engagement with class materials
2. Effectiveness of teamwork

You will *not* be graded for argumentative merits (e.g. *Does Dr. Stephan agree?*). What matters is that you are *working together to consider the materials of the class in a deeper manner than you would be able to do without preparing a formal debate.*

#### Allowed Sources

* Anything from class, including video lectures, class notes, notes from study group recordings, anything in the Catholic Study Bible (all of which is peer reviewed), anything in any of our required course books, etc.
* Any academic literature, such as what one finds nearly everywhere in our Library
* Any traditionally vetted and edited journalistic publications, such as the Houston Chronicle, the Dallas Star, the New York Times, etc.
* Any informative (factual) material from major, established non-profit or governmental organizations, such as the UN, the CDC, etc.

#### Disallowed Sources

* Blogs, podcasts, and other non-reviewed/unedited sources of commentary
* Alternative or non-traditional news sources (two examples being the Huffington Post and Breitbart News)

Some disallowed sources do (at least at times) provide valuable contributions to our public discourse, enlightening commentary, and other good things, but what disallows them for a university class is that they are not factually, editorially, and/or academically vetted in the way that we need our sources to be.

#### Background / Why, Dr. Stephan?

We live in a twenty-first century American context in which even high-ranking elected officials who ought to conduct themselves with the loftiest honor refuse to address each other with a bare minimum of courtesy, such as by saying "Mr. President," "Madam Secretary," "Senator," etc., and far be it from such persons to address each other with genuine respect. Yet, at the University of St. Thomas, we take pride in maintaining a culture of deep civility. One of my main purposes in requiring these team debates is to bring to fruition in our upper classmen -- before you graduate -- the spirit of civility that you have been growing through your entire time here at the University of St. Thomas. Celts do not disparage with scowls; you debate with smiles.

With all of that in mind, each teammate is expected to refer to his/her adversary by his/her formal title, that is, "Mr. / Ms. / Sr. / Fr. So-and-So," as well as "Sir / Ma'am." Additionally, you must dress in attire that is appropriate to a formal debate for your recording. For a male student, this means a tie and jacket (or as close as you might happen to own), and for a female student, this means your equivalent (business suit, nice dress and sweater, or what you might happen to own). 

#### P.S. -- Clothing, etc.

You should not purchase clothing only for this debate. The Title V Student Success folks have business attire available for students to 'check out' for free (I do *not* know the details of this; if you might be interested, please call our Title V office). 

At the same time, since you are approaching graduation, if you do not yet have proper formal business attire to wear to job interviews, you might take this as an extra nudge to go invest in said attire. It is extremely important for (nearly) any sort of formal interview for a university graduate -- graduate school (Ph.D., Master's, or other), professional school (M.D., J.D., or other), internship, full-time job, etc. -- that the graduate be dressed in correctly fitting (tailored), business formal attire (full suit or equivalent).

Anyway, role-playing is a major part of this assignment. Have fun!
