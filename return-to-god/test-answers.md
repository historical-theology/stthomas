Question 1: What is theology? Answer at a level appropriate to this 3000-level, capstone class. In other words, answer with profundity.

Student Answer: Theology is an understanding and practicing of one's faith. In relation to Catholic theology, theology is the the practice and actions of knowing, love, and serving God. Through theology, man is able to to think about and form a relationship with the God we believe in. St. Anselm of Canterbury described theology as "fides quaerens intellectum", which means, “faith seeking understanding.” Theology is the integration of faith and wisdom through reason to reveal God's presence to ourselves in the world. Theology is essential towards eternal unity with God because it reminds us that while we use our knowledge and reason to understand God, we also need the faith to enlighten our minds, order our souls, and strengthen our hearts.

Question 2: First, summarize the ancient Near Eastern understanding of the structure of the world that is shared by the ancient Hebrews in the text of Genesis 1. Second, explain the theology of creation that the ancient Hebrew(s) who authored that text depicted inside that view of the world/cosmos.

Student Answer: The ancient Near Eastern understanding of the world is clearly depicted in Genesis 1. The earth is explained as flat and surrounded by water, with a solid dome, separating the waters above from the earth below. Above this dome are the heavens, while the earth is the dwelling place for humans and animals. Beneath the earth is the underworld. Comparatively, the theology of creation in Genesis 1 portrays God as the supreme creator who brings order to the cosmos through His word alone. Unlike other Near Eastern creation myths that involve conflicts or battles between gods, Genesis 1 presents creation as a peaceful, orderly process, where God speaks and the world is formed. Everything in creation has a specific place and function, showing that creation is intentional and purposeful. This emphasizes God's absolute power, His benevolence in creating a harmonious world, and the special role of humans, made in His image, as caretakers of this ordered creation, much like what is demonstrated to us in Genesis 2-3. 

Question 3: Explain the relationship between God, on the one hand, and the man and the woman, on the other hand, in the story of Genesis 2-3.

Student Answer: The relationship between God and the man and the woman is that of father-child relationship and also to an extent, that of a shared royal relationship. As God created Adam and breathed lifed into him, God is Adam's father. God loves Adam as His son, as he is made in His own image and likeness while Adam loves God as a father as God is his creator. God also cares for the man and the woman as a father as he provides them with food from the vast majority of the trees in the Garden. God, who is the creator and ruler of the world, extends His royal authority to the man and the woman as He tells them to have dominion over all the animals on the Earth. After the original sin and the fall of man, this relationship is weakened. As the couple is banished from the Garden of Eden, they are no longer in as intimate of a relationship with God, instead of God providing for them like a father, they must work for their food, and their roayal dominion over the animals is weakened tremendously.

Question 4: Early in the Hexaemeron (Homily 1), St. Basil writes: "In the beginning God made heaven and earth." By naming the two extremes, he suggests the substance of the whole world, according to heaven the privilege of seniority, and putting earth in the second rank. All intermediate beings were created at the same time as the extremities. Thus, although there is no mention of the elements, fire, water and air, imagine that they were all compounded together, and you will find water, air and fire, in the earth." (1 word answer) Who is "he"? That is, who does Basil believe to be the historical author of the Book of Genesis? (Paragraph answer) What does Basil mean in these sentences? What does Basil understand the author of Genesis to be communicating when "he" writes that "in the beginning God made" "the two extremes" of "heaven and earth"?

Student Answer: Basil believes Moses to be the historical author of the Book of Genesis. What Basil means in these sentences is that God made the universe ex nihilo or out of nothing. There were no elements in the beginning, rather everything, including fire, water, and air were created together. In other words, he explains that when the earth was created, so was water, air, and fire. This is because these elements are found on Earth. Furthermore, according to Basil, God made heaven and earth; they had not been present since the beginning. 

Question 5: According to St. Maximus the Confessor [in our assigned readings], why did God create humans?

2 brief student answers, showcasing separate 10/10 (satisfactory) approaches:

Student Answer A: St. Maximus believed that God created humans to serve as mediators between God and creation. He thought that humans have a specific role to fulfill within the cosmos. Although the original plan for humanity was disrupted by the Fall, our purpose now is also to seek God for salvation.

Student Answer B: According to St. Maximus the Confessor, God created humans to unite and live in harmony with Him. Human beings weren't created to serve or worship God, humans were created to share in His divine love and become like God in goodness and love. St. Maximus states, "God has made us like himself, and allowed us to participate in the very things that are most chatacterisitc of his goodness" (On the Cosmic Mystery of Jesus Christ, 70). God created humans to experience His love and give it back to the world. 

Question 6: What might St. Bonaventure's depiction of St. Francis of Assisi in the *Life of Francis* tell us about God's original plan for the relationships between humans and non-human creation and between humans and God?

Student Answer: St. Bonaventure's depiction of St. Francis of Assisi in the Life of Francis tells us that God's original plan was for humans to be in a close relationship with each other, non-human creation, and between God. For instance, Francis had a special love for the poor. At one point in the text, he questioned whether or not he should continue to preach or focus more on praying. However, he felt God told him to preach because we are made to help each other. Hence, we are made to be in communion with each other. In addition to this, Francis had an unusually close relationship with non-human creation. For example, chapter 8 mentions birds were singing loudly, he told them to be quiet, and they listened. This also shows that God's original plan was for humans to direct the animals. Finally, Francis had a close relationship with God. For instance, he was given the gift of stigmata in which he was able to feel Jesus' pain on the cross. Furthermore, St. Francis had a love so strong for God that he wanted to die for him as it says in chapter 9. Overall, God's original plan was for humans to be in a close relationship with each other, non-human creation, and especially, with God. 


Question 7: While reading St. Bonaventure's *Life of St. Francis*, what did you find most compelling about the life of Francis of Assisi? Be specific. Now, explain what the specific part/aspect of Francis's life that you have chosen might teach us about the traditional Christian understanding of the ideal human life.

Since this is partly a question of personal reflection, here are 2 separate student approaches, each of which earned a score of 10/10 (satisfactory) --

Student Answer A: What I found the most compelling about the life of Francis of Assist was how he abondoned his family. I think it surprised me, because even through having a hard situation like that one, he kept being so faithful in his Savior. Francis was going to rebuild the Church he prayed in, and he used his dads' money to do so, since he came from a wealthy family. But, he never asked for approval from his father, so he accused Francis over being a theft. It made Francis feel horribel, but it ended up making him let go of his father and the things he owned because he wanted to live through the call of God. This gives me a reminder that above all of the materialistic things, God will always come first and our faith in him will be the only thing to lead us to Heaven. 

Student Answer B: While reading, one can not help but feel in awe of the strict discipline that St. Francis exemplifies in his daily devotion. However, when St. Francis prays to God out of worry for his friars, God remind him that it is He who protects them and allows them to follow His will. This specific situation drew me back to remember that although St. Francis appears perfect, he is not. St. Francis shares the word of the God that is perfect; he himself is not and God has chosen him to enact His will. I believe God further expresses that it is not because of St. Francis that the Order prospered as he is nothing but a simple man; God's divinity is what allowed it to grow. I believe this particular part of his life reminds humanity that, yes, we should always have faith and devote our lives to God; however, just because we do so and good comes out of it, we are not divine like our maker. We are servants who depend on Him, and our lifestyle should reflect that understanding.
