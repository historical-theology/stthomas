Notes:

1. As of the start of the semester, some aspects of this syllabus remain to be determined.
2. I reserve the right to revise this syllabus at any time during the semester.

***

> Faith and reason are like two wings on which the human spirit rises to the contemplation of truth; and God has placed in the human heart a desire to know the truth—in a word, to know himself—so that, by knowing and loving God, men and women may also come to the fullness of truth about themselves. 
> 
>  Pope St. John Paul II, *Fides et Ratio*, §1

***

An introductory course in fundamental Catholic theology, presenting the basic openness of the human person to divine revelation, the historical veracity of that revelation, and selected major theological themes in the Catholic worldview, with an eye to their coherence with one another and with the human person.

***

## Journey
In this course, you will be introduced to what Catholic theology is, what its distinctive features and principles are, and why Catholic belief is reasonable. In so doing, you will deepen your understanding of yourself as a rational, free being, capable of affirming what is true and of freely embracing the purpose of your existence.

## Destination

By the end of the semester, you will be able:

1. To explain the reasonableness of the Christian worldview in terms of human rationality and freedom. 
2. To define the central Christian principles of faith, nature, grace, creation, and sin.
3. To explain the historical veracity of the Gospel accounts through a thorough analysis of issues of dating, genre, authorship, and external and internal witnesses.
4. To articulate the notion of Christian revelation, as well as modern objections.

I, Dr. Stephan, will consider anything short of this to be a failure—possibly mine, but possibly yours. This must be a team effort.

To that end, we have a "Faith, Reason, & Revelation Class Survey and Contract" in the "Start" page in Blackboard that everyone is required to complete and sign by the end of the first week.

Above all, note that you are expected to do all assigned readings and watch or listen to all assigned lectures every week.

***

## Recommended Books

You are **not** required to purchase any book(s) for this class.

You are, however, strongly recommended to purchase the specific Study Bible from which we will be reading several major portions this semester, that is,

*  *The Catholic Study Bible: Third Edition* [Catholic Study Bible]
	* ISBN 9780190267230

Basically, this serves as our textbook. No other printed Bible suffices for our purposes, since this has specific historical, linguistic, and other scholarly information that is of highest importance for our university-level, academic context.

The following 3 items also form an integral part of the class. Accordingly, any student who prefers to hold a physical book rather than read documents online ought to purchase each of these, rent them, or otherwise acquire them when readings from them are assigned. Yet, the selections from them that you are required to read are available in Blackboard.

* *The Catechism of the Catholic Church* [CCC]
	* ISBN 0385508190 or 1601376499
	* Also available online on the [Vatican website](https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_INDEX.HTM)
* Mother Teresa, *Where There is Love, There is God* [Teresa]
	* ISBN 9780385531801
* Brant Pitre, *The Case for Jesus* [Pitre]
	* ISBN 978-0-385-36593-2

## Other Materials

I distribute other assigned reading materials in Blackboard either as .pdf scans or via hyperlinks to online materials in the public domain.

***

## Themes 

The course is divided into three thematic units:

1. What are Faith and Reason?
2. Apparent Clashes of Faith and Reason
3. Revelation

***

## Grades

The total class grade is weighted out of 100 points.

1. Start of Term: (5%) CLASS SURVEY AND CONTRACT

2. Semester Long: (50%) CONTENT QUIZZES

* 10 quizzes on assigned content (Readings & Lectures)
* The lowest content quiz score is automatically dropped from the gradebook
* The total score for Content Quizzes is calculated cumulatively (simple point addition of total available points)

3. Early Term: (20%) SHORT ANSWER TEST

* Short paragraphs synthesizing the material from Unit 1 in your own reasoned language, thinking of yourself as 'instructing the instructor'

4. End of Term: (20%) CUMULATIVE EXAM

* Timed, full-length final exam based on the content quizzes

5. End of Term: (5%) LEARNING OBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT QUIZ

* Online assessment quiz required for University accreditation

## Schedule

You are expected to have completed each week's required lectures and readings *prior to* the Content Quiz or other task for that week.

Each instance of "Blackboard #" corresponds to a specific matching numbered module (folder) inside the "Readings & Lectures" tab in Blackboard.

**In this online and asynchronous class (with me, Dr. Stephan), you *always* have the option to work ahead. Every listed deadline is *only* the final deadline for that specific task.**
