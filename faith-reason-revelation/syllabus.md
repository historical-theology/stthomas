## Core Curriculum

# Faith, Reason, and Revelation

Corey Stephan, Ph.D.

Fall 2022

*A syllabus inspired by Sr. Albert Marie Surmanski, O.P., Ph.D.'s*

Faith and reason are like two wings on which the human spirit rises to the contemplation of truth; 
and God has placed in the human heart a desire to know the truth—in a word, 
to know himself—so that, by knowing and loving God, 
men and women may also come to the fullness of truth about themselves.

- St. John Paul II, Fides et Ratio, §1

An introductory course in fundamental Catholic theology, 
presenting the basic openness of the human person to divine revelation,
the historical veracity of that revelation,
and selected major theological themes in the Catholic worldview,
with an eye to their coherence with one another and with the human person.

## Journey
In this course, you will be introduced to what Catholic theology is, 
what its distinctive features and principles are, and why Catholic belief is reasonable. 
In so doing, you will deepen your understanding of yourself as a rational, free being, 
capable of affirming what is true and of freely embracing the purpose of you existence.

## Destination

By the end of the semester:

1. You will explain the reasonableness of the Christian worldview in terms of human rationality and freedom. 
2. You will be able to define central Christian principles of faith, nature, grace, creation, and sin.
3. You will explain the historical veracity of the Gospel accounts through a thorough analysis of issues of dating, genre, authorship, and external and internal witnesses.
4. You will articulate the notion of Christian revelation, as well as modern objections.

I, Dr. Stephan, will consider anything short of this to be a failure -- most likely mine, but possibly yours.
This must be a team effort.

To that end, we have a [Faith, Reason, & Revelation Class Contract](https://www.***)
that all of us, myself included, are required to sign by the end of the first week.

Above all, note that you are expected:
1. To do all assigned readings and watch or listen to all assigned lectures every week,
2. To meet virtually in your study group every week and to upload the results of that meeting on Blackboard, and
3. To prepare for a video meeting with the instructor (me, Dr. Stephan) every other Thursday (by doing #1 and #2).

Each week, then, you will follow the following rhythm:

* Reading and Lectures (Saturday, Monday-Thursday)-> 
* Group Meeting (Wednesday or Thursday) -> 
* Instructor Meeting (Friday)

A tablet *might* work, but a proper computer

## University Policies

### Accommodations
If you have an academic accommodation and wish to make use of it,
you are strongly encouraged to do so. As a general rule, I will receive your accom-
modation letter directly from the Office of Counseling and Disability Services.
However, I encourage you to check with me (Dr. Stephan) to make sure that I have received and
implemented any accommodations to which you are entitled. Any student with a
disability requiring accommodations in this course is encouraged to contact me
after class or during office hours. Discussions of matters pertaining to academic
accommodations will remain confidential. Additionally, students seeking such
an accommodation will need to contact Counseling and Disability Services (CDS)
in Crooker Center. This office can be reached at (713) 525-2169 or 6953.

### Preparation
You must have all the required textbooks, ideally as soon as the class be-
gins. Their ISBN numbers must match those on the syllabus. It is the student’s
responsibility, not the bookstore’s, to arrange to have the proper books.

### Meetings
I encourage you to meet with the TA outside of the classroom, especially
for guidance on the readings and assignments. Generally, appointments will be
handled via Teams.

### Communication
You must use university email or Teams for electronic correspondence
with me and with the TA. Any lost or missed communication as a result of using
third party email, or failing to maintain one’s UST email account under quota will
be considered the student’s fault.

## Other Class Policies

### Late Submissions
I know that life happens, and I know that the best work sometimes has to be submitted late
(the Sistine Chapel's painting went behind schedule, after all).

At the same time, this class is a team effort, so
we all must strive to have our work to share with each other on time.
Even one 'weak link' can tear down everyone's experience; you
(as an individual student) really do matter to the class as a whole.

With all that in mind, let me make this policy as simple as possible:
1. With legitimate excuse(s), I will accept up to 2 late submissions from you with no penalty.
2. Without legitimate excuse(s), or if you are submitting a third item
(of three formal submissions, no less!) late, then you will incur a 10% penalty per day.
3. After the grading deadline has passed at the end of the semester,
I will not accept any more work.

### Revision
For either the Augustine video presentation or the Liturgy attendance assignment,
if you are not satisfied with your grade,
you may do a full revision (or even start from scratch) and resubmit
for full credit as though it were your first submission.

Other assignments are too linked to specific moments in time for revision to be possible,
but it is important to me that you be able to be graded for your best work,
which might mean needing to revise it after you have received my constructive feedback.
