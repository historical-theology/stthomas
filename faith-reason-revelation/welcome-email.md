Greetings, Nascent Theologians. 

My name is Dr. Stephan (STEH-fin), and I am pleased that you are joining me this semester for THEOC 1301: Faith, Reason, and Revelation. For more information about me, visit coreystephan.com.

All of my Faith, Reason, & Revelation class sections for Spring 2023 will be in Anderson 105, including:
THEOC 1301-A (1399) 8:10-9:00 MWF
THEOC 1301-B (1400) 9:10-10:00 MWF
THEOC 1301-C (1401) 10:10-11:00 MWF

Check your own registration for your correct class period and time. I am letting you know that I have these three back-to-back sections simply in case one or two of you might wish to switch to a different one last-minute to help your life scheduling. 

Our first meeting will be tomorrow morning (Wednesday, January 18).

On this first day of the term, I have 3 important 'getting started' steps to assign to you. Ideally, you would be able to accomplish all of them before class tomorrow, but you have until the end of this week.

I. Go to Blackboard -> START: Webpage, Syllabus, & Survey, and
1.  Bookmark the syllabus page (99% complete) (and, perhaps, download and/or print the syllabus as-is).
2.  *Complete the "Faith, Reason, & Revelation Class Survey & Contract" (IMPORTANT).*

II. Purchase the 4 books that you are required to own for this class (our textbooks, to which we will turn frequently and together). All 4 of these should be available at the Bookstore, as well as eBay, Barnes & Noble, and other stores -- and even from a good number of older St. Thomas students:
1. The Catholic Study Bible: Third Edition
	* ISBN 9780190267230
2. The Catechism of the Catholic Church
	* ISBN 0385508190 or 1601376499
	* Also available online on the [Vatican website](https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_INDEX.HTM) and USCCB.org -- If you are trying to save as much money as possible, you may use the Catechism electronically only, but you must own a physical copy of every other volume.
3. Mother Teresa, Where There is Love, There is God
	* ISBN 9780385531801
4. Brant Pitre, The Case for Jesus
	* ISBN 978-0-385-36593-2

III. Go to Blackboard -> Readings & Lectures -> 1. Introductions and digest the two video lectures listed under "What are we doing here?," namely, "What is this Faith, Reason, and Revelation class?" and "Faith, Reason, & Revelation: Syllabus and Class Bones (Spring 2023)."

With that, my bowties and I are looking forward to working with you for our second semester at the University of St. Thomas.

Deus vos benedicat,
Dr. Stephan
