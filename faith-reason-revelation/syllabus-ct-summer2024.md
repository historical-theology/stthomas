Summer Session I -- 2024

THEOC 1301-A, 8:10-12:10 TuTh, Malloy Hall 014

*Syllabus Beta, Updated 5/13*

Notes:

1. As of the start of the term, some aspects of this syllabus remain to be determined.
2. I reserve the right to revise this syllabus at any time during the term.

***

> Faith and reason are like two wings on which the human spirit rises to the contemplation of truth; and God has placed in the human heart a desire to know the truth—in a word, to know himself—so that, by knowing and loving God, men and women may also come to the fullness of truth about themselves. 
> 
>  Pope St. John Paul II, *Fides et Ratio*, §1

***

An introductory course in fundamental Catholic theology, presenting the basic openness of the human person to divine revelation, the historical veracity of that revelation, and selected major theological themes in the Catholic worldview, with an eye to their coherence with one another and with the human person.

***

## Journey

In this course, you will be introduced to what Catholic theology is, what its distinctive features and principles are, and why Catholic belief is reasonable. In so doing, you will deepen your understanding of yourself as a rational, free being, capable of affirming what is true and of freely embracing the purpose of your existence.

## Destination

By the end of the term, you will be able:

1. To explain the reasonableness of the Christian worldview in terms of human rationality and freedom. 
2. To define the central Christian principles of faith, nature, grace, creation, and sin.
3. To explain the historical veracity of the Gospel accounts through a thorough analysis of issues of dating, genre, authorship, and external and internal witnesses.
4. To articulate the notion of Christian revelation, as well as modern objections.

I, Dr. Stephan, will consider anything short of this to be a failure—most likely mine, but possibly yours. This must be a team effort.

To that end, we have a "Faith, Reason, & Revelation Class Survey and Contract" in the "Start" page in Blackboard that everyone, myself included, is required to complete and sign by the end of the first week.

Above all, note that you are expected:

1. To do all assigned readings and watch or listen to all assigned lectures every week.
2. To be prepared for engaging full-group and small group discussions at every required meeting.

***

## Grades

The total class grade is weighted out of 100 points.

1. Start of Term: (2.5%) CLASS SURVEY AND CONTRACT

2. Semester Long: (15%) ATTENDANCE

* To receive **full credit** for this category during this abbreviated summer term (in which every period is equivalent to 3 regular semester periods), you may (only) miss **1 class period**, *including for undocumented sickness.*
* This category will be tabulated with a simple percentage *at the end of the term.*
	* That means that if you look in your gradebook in Blackboard and see that you have, say, 1 absence, you actually still have a score of 100% for attendance. Blackboard does not allow the instructor to automatically exempt a certain number of absences.
* University-excused absences are excluded from the attendance grade tabulation, provided that you remind me of your official excuse. 
	* Tracking any excused absence(s) that you might have, and ensuring that they end up entered into Blackboard (by me), is your responsibility as the student.
* No other absences are excused (excluded from the tabulation), unless you should provide a documented medical, legal, or other circumstance that precludes you from attending class (e.g. a letter from a medical or legal office) to me, the instructor.

3. Semester Long: (20%) TRUTH TROOP TEAM TASKS

* Graded tasks with in-class learning groups

4. Unit 1: (20%) ONE-ON-ONE MEETING (Early Term Exam)

* 1st one-on-one meeting / oral exam with the instructor (me, Dr. Stephan)

5. Unit 2: (20%) PARTNER/GROUP DEBATE (Midterm Project)

* Partner or small group 'staged' argument for and against one aspect of traditional Christian belief
* Each pair or group will be required to provide critical feedback on 3 other pairs' or groups'

6. Unit 3: (20%) IN-CLASS ESSAY (Final Exam)

* In-class, handwritten or typed (details TBA) cumulative essay

7. End of Term: (2.5%) LEARNING OBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT QUIZ

* Online assessment quiz required for University accreditation

#### Totals

* Individual Grades = 60%
	* Class survey, 2.5%
	* Attendance, 15%
	* One-on-One Meetings / Oral Exam, 20%
	* In-class Essay, 20%
	* Assessment Quiz, 2.5%

## University Policies

### Accommodations

In accordance with Section 504 of the Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the University of St. Thomas will provide academic accommodations to ensure access for students with disabilities.
     
Students with disabilities who require accommodations for this class, must register with the Office of Access & Disability Services (ADS) and provide documentation of a disability to determine what accommodations are most appropriate. Please note that accommodations are not retroactive and disability accommodations are not provided until a Course Accessibility Letter has been provided to the instructor. For questions regarding academic accommodations and accessibility, please contact the Office of Access and Disability Services by email at ACCESS@STTHOM.EDU, or visit the ADS website at STTHOM.EDU/ACCESS.

### Preparation

You must have all the required textbooks, ideally as soon as the class begins. Their ISBN numbers must match those on the syllabus. It is your responsibility, not the bookstore’s, to arrange to have the proper books.

### Meetings

I encourage you to meet with me (Dr. Stephan) outside of the classroom, especially for guidance on the readings and assignments. Generally, appointments will be handled during my office hours (as listed at the beginning of this document).

### Communication

You must use university email for electronic correspondence with me. Any lost or missed communication as a result of using third party email, or failing to maintain one’s UST email account under quota will be considered the student’s fault.

***

## Other Class Policies

### Electronic Devices

Electronic devices such as laptop computers and digital tablets are only permitted in class when situationally required, such as for doing a group project or accessing a specific digital reading -- or, of course, for students with documented medical conditions (notably, visual impairments) that require the use of specific electronic accessories. Otherwise, they should not be used in class. I (Dr. Stephan) strongly prefer that such electronic devices be kept in students' bags.

I might ask a student who distracts other students and/or the instructor with out-of-place electronic device usage to leave the class for the day; that student would then be marked as "Absent" against his/her attendance record (grade).

Cell phone usage is never appropriate in a classroom. If you should have an urgent matter to address that requires making a telephone call or text messaging, then you ought to step out of the room to take care of it.

### Late Submissions

I (Dr. Stephan) know that life happens, and I know that the best work sometimes has to be submitted late (the Sistine Chapel's painting went behind schedule, after all). At the same time, this class is a team effort, so we all must strive to have our work to share with each other on time. Even one 'weak link' can tear down everyone's experience; you (as an individual student) really do matter to the class as a whole.

With all that in mind, I have structured class assignments in such a way that there should not be any legitimate reason for anyone to make a late submission. Most late submissions will incur a late penalty, and, occasionally, I will not be able to accept a late submission at all.

### Statement on Software Freedom
I (Dr. Stephan) am a longtime advocate of Free Software as defined by the [Free Software Foundation](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html). I encourage you to teach yourself about software freedom. For my part, I promise that I will never require you to use non-free software, except tools that are currently required as part of our experience at the University of St. Thomas (e.g. Microsoft Teams and Blackboard). To the contrary, whenever possible, I will encourage you to prepare your work in free software and submit it in formats with open standards.

## Class Prayer
A Prayer by St. Thomas Aquinas

> Grant, O Merciful God, that I may ardently desire, prudently examine, truthfully acknowledge, and perfectly accomplish what is pleasing to Thee for the praise and glory of Thy name. Amen.
