# Faith, Reason, and Revelation

## TRIO DEBATES

### Corey Stephan, Ph.D.

##### Fall 2024

*Last updated on October 13, 2024*

*For clarifications, please write to Dr. Stephan.*

Each student will be in a trio to produce a formal, scripted debate about 1 aspect of traditional Christian belief, specifically one in which there is an apparent clash between faith and reason.

I expect that each trio will choose a sub-topic within one theme from the class, most likely Unit 2: Apparent Clashes Between Faith and Reason, *or* some special topic of its members' choosing that relates (clearly, even if only tangentially) to the themes of the class. For example, a trio might elect to choose the Problem of Evil as its theme with St. Irenaeus's soul-making theodicy as its special sub-topic. For another example, a trio might discuss something pertaining to a current hot topic in matters of human sexuality inasmuch as it relates with what it means to be human (Genesis 1, Genesis 2-3, etc.), what sin is, a particular dimension of the Problem of Evil, or some other theme of the class.

#### Basic Parameters

Each debate should fit the following parameters:

* Full video recording showing each partner's name and face in Blackboard -> Debates & Discussions -> PARTNER DEBATES -> [New thread]
* 10 minutes in duration (7 minutes minimum, 13 minutes maximum)
* Formal business attire
* Formal forms of address for one another, whether using real names (e.g. "Mr. Smith") or assumed personae (e.g. "Professor Smith")

Recommended:

* Approximately 1 minute opening statement from each side (including a clear introduction, that is, "My name is So-and-So, and I will be arguing such-and-such"), 3-9 minutes of back-and-forth, and 1 minute closing statement from each side
* Memorization (but scripts may be read, as long as the reading is done with 'heads up' in an overall lively manner)

To fit these parameters, *you must work together before the time of the debate to script your debates.* Using a shared document writing platform to which you already have access is a good idea. Here at the University of St. Thomas, we have ready-at-hand access to Microsoft Office 365 with Microsoft Word online as a collaborative writing tool that requires no outside accounts.

#### Trios

There are 2 basic formats for this project that work especially well in trios (groups of 3):

(1) Moderator, Debater, Debater

In this format, the moderator serves as an *informed debate steerer*, asking helpful questions, providing factual context for points made, and so on. Each debater assumes the role of an expert on either side of a topic that is not challenging to paint as 1 side vs. 1 side.

(2) Debater <--> Debater <--> Debater

In this format, there are 3 debaters, each of which assumes the role of an expert representing 1 position within a fraught topic. The debaters form a panel, engaging each other in an honest debate.

#### Formal Feedback

After uploading the debate itself (asynchronous) and script (all classes) as a new thread in the Blackboard forum, partners should work together to provide critical feedback to **3 other trios' debates in their own respective threads.** To be graded properly, you must sign *all three* of your names to each response that you write. Each response must contain:

* 1 tangible point of praise for something argued (e.g. "The person who argued for A was right about B because of X and Y.")
* 1 point of critical feedback about something argued (e.g. "The point that each of you made about X contradicts points Y and Z that we have encountered elsewhere in class, specifically in...")
* 1 question for the original pair to consider, to which the original pair may choose to respond

Trios will be graded **together** for *both* your prepared debate recordings *and* your joint responses to 3 other trios.

You will be graded chiefly for two categories:
1. Engagement with class materials
2. Effectiveness of teamwork

You will *not* be graded for argumentative merits (e.g. *Does Dr. Stephan agree?*). What matters is that you are *working together to consider the materials of the class in a deeper manner than you would be able to do without preparing a formal debate.*

#### Allowed Sources

* Anything from class, including video lectures, class notes, notes from Creation Myth Sketches, anything in the Catholic Study Bible (all of which is peer reviewed), anything in the Catechism, etc.
* Any academic literature, such as what one finds nearly everywhere in our Library
* Any traditionally vetted and edited journalistic publications, such as the Houston Chronicle, the Dallas Star, the New York Times, etc.
* Any informative (factual) material from major, established non-profit organizations

#### Disallowed Sources

* Blogs, podcasts, and other non-reviewed/unedited sources of commentary
* Alternative or non-traditional news sources (two examples being the Huffington Post and Breitbart News)

Some disallowed sources do (at least at times) provide valuable contributions to our public discourse, enlightening commentary, and other good things, but what disallows them for a university class is that they are not factually, editorially, and/or academically vetted in the way that we need our sources to be.

#### Background / Why, Dr. Stephan?

We live in a twenty-first century American context in which even high-ranking elected officials who ought to conduct themselves with the loftiest honor refuse to address each other with a bare minimum of courtesy, such as by saying "Mr. President," "Madam Secretary," "Senator," etc., and far be it from such persons to address each other with genuine respect. Yet, at the University of St. Thomas, we take pride in maintaining a culture of deep civility. One of my main purposes in requiring these partner debates is to foster in our freshmen and sophomores a spirit of civility that you will take with you throughout your lives -- an ability to debate with a smile rather than disparage with a scowl. To that end, each partner is expected to refer to his/her adversary by his/her formal title, that is, "Mr. / Miss So-and-So," as well as "Sir / Ma'am." Additionally, you must dress in attire that is appropriate to a formal debate for your recording. For a male student, this means a tie and jacket (or as close as you might happen to own), and for a female student, this means your equivalent (business suit, nice dress and sweater, or what you might happen to own).

Role-playing is a major part of this assignment. Have fun!
