Notes:

1. As of the start of the semester, some aspects of this syllabus remain to be determined.
2. I reserve the right to revise this syllabus at any time during the semester.

***

> Faith and reason are like two wings on which the human spirit rises to the contemplation of truth; and God has placed in the human heart a desire to know the truth—in a word, to know himself—so that, by knowing and loving God, men and women may also come to the fullness of truth about themselves. 
> 
>  Pope St. John Paul II, *Fides et Ratio*, §1

***

An introductory course in fundamental Catholic theology, presenting the basic openness of the human person to divine revelation, the historical veracity of that revelation, and selected major theological themes in the Catholic worldview, with an eye to their coherence with one another and with the human person.

***

## Journey
In this course, you will be introduced to what Catholic theology is, what its distinctive features and principles are, and why Catholic belief is reasonable. In so doing, you will deepen your understanding of yourself as a rational, free being, capable of affirming what is true and of freely embracing the purpose of your existence.

## Destination

By the end of the semester, you will be able:

1. To explain the reasonableness of the Christian worldview in terms of human rationality and freedom. 
2. To define the central Christian principles of faith, nature, grace, creation, and sin.
3. To explain the historical veracity of the Gospel accounts through a thorough analysis of issues of dating, genre, authorship, and external and internal witnesses.
4. To articulate the notion of Christian revelation, as well as modern objections.

I, Dr. Stephan, will consider anything short of this to be a failure—possibly mine, but possibly yours. This must be a team effort.

To that end, we have a "Faith, Reason, & Revelation Class Survey and Contract" in the "Start" page in Blackboard that everyone is required to complete and sign by the end of the first week.

Above all, note that you are expected to do all assigned readings and watch or listen to all assigned lectures every week.

***

## Required Book

You are only required to purchase one item for this class, namely,

*  *The Catholic Study Bible: Third Edition* [Catholic Study Bible]
	* ISBN 9780190267230

This serves basically as our textbook. No other printed Bible suffices for our purposes, since this has specific historical, linguistic, and other scholarly information that is of highest importance for our university-level, academic context.

## Recommended / Other Books

The following 3 items form an integral part of the class. Accordingly, any student who prefers to hold a physical book rather than read documents online ought to purchase them. Yet, none of them are required to be purchased. Rather, starting with this Spring 2025 semester, the required reading selections from inside them will be distributed in Blackboard.

* *The Catechism of the Catholic Church* [CCC]
	* ISBN 0385508190 or 1601376499
	* Also available online on the [Vatican website](https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_INDEX.HTM)
* Mother Teresa, *Where There is Love, There is God* [Teresa]
	* ISBN 9780385531801
* Brant Pitre, *The Case for Jesus* [Pitre]
	* ISBN 978-0-385-36593-2

## Other Materials

I distribute other assigned reading materials in Blackboard either as .pdf scans or via hyperlinks to online materials in the public domain.

***

## Themes 

The course is divided into three thematic units:

1. What are Faith and Reason?
2. Apparent Clashes of Faith and Reason
3. Revelation

***

## Grades

The total class grade is weighted out of 100 points.

1. Start of Term: (5%) CLASS SURVEY AND CONTRACT

2. Semester Long: (50%) CONTENT QUIZZES

* Weekly quiz on assigned content (readings & lectures)
* The lowest content quiz score is automatically dropped from the gradebook
* The total score is calculated cumulatively (simple point addition of total available points)

3. Early Term: (20%) SHORT ANSWER TEST

* 1 class period of writing paragraphs synthesizing the material from Unit 1 in your own reasoned language, thinking of yourselves as 'instructing the instructor'

4. End of Term: (20%) CUMULATIVE EXAM

5. End of Term: (5%) LEARNING OBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT QUIZ

* Online assessment quiz required for University accreditation

## Schedule

## University Policies

### Accommodations

In accordance with Section 504 of the Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the University of St. Thomas will provide academic accommodations to ensure access for students with disabilities.
     
Students with disabilities who require accommodations for this class, must register with the Office of Access & Disability Services (ADS) and provide documentation of a disability to determine what accommodations are most appropriate. Please note that accommodations are not retroactive and disability accommodations are not provided until a Course Accessibility Letter has been provided to the instructor. For questions regarding academic accommodations and accessibility, please contact the Office of Access and Disability Services by email at ACCESS@STTHOM.EDU, or visit the ADS website at STTHOM.EDU/ACCESS.

### Textbook

You must have The Catholic Study Bible: Third Edition.

### Meetings

I encourage you to meet with me (Dr. Stephan), especially for guidance on the readings and assignments. Generally, appointments will be handled during my office hours (as listed at the beginning of this document).

### Communication

You must use university email for electronic correspondence with me. I do not communicate digitally with students via any other means.

***

## Other Class Policies

### Late Submissions

I (Dr. Stephan) know that life happens, and I know that the best work sometimes has to be submitted late (the Sistine Chapel's painting went behind schedule, after all). At the same time, this class is a team effort, so we all must strive to have our work to share with each other on time. Even one 'weak link' can tear down everyone's experience; you (as an individual student) really do matter to the class as a whole.

With all that in mind, I have structured class assignments in such a way that there should not be any legitimate reason for anyone to make a late submission. Most late submissions will incur a late penalty, and, occasionally, I will not be able to accept a late submission at all.

### Statement on Software Freedom
I (Dr. Stephan) am a longtime advocate of Free Software as defined by the [Free Software Foundation](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html). I encourage you to teach yourself about software freedom. For my part, I promise that I will never require you to use non-free software -- except class infrastructural tools that are currently required as part of our experience at the University of St. Thomas (e.g. Microsoft Teams and Blackboard) or otherwise of practical necessity for our work at hand. Whenever possible, I will encourage you to prepare your work in free software and submit it in formats with open standards.

## Class Prayer
A Prayer by St. Thomas Aquinas

> Grant, O Merciful God, that I may ardently desire, prudently examine, truthfully acknowledge, and perfectly accomplish what is pleasing to Thee for the praise and glory of Thy name. Amen.
